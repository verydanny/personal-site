# Personal Site

I wrote this site to learn Svelte as well as set up a super easy, super flexible, hot-reloadable
server-side Svelte developmnet environment. It uses my `webpack-universal-compiler` to show how
easy it is to configure it for other libraries besides React. 

### Tech

- **Svelte**
- **TypeScript**
- **ESLint**
- **Webpack**
- **Hot Module Reloading (server and client)**
- **Editor syntax highlighting and auto-completion**

### Todo

- [ ] **Routing**
- [ ] **Code Splitting**
- [ ] **SCSS**
