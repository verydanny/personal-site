# Personal Site

I wrote this site to learn Svelte as well as set up a super easy, super flexible, hot-reloadable
server-side Svelte developmnet environment. It uses my `webpack-universal-compiler` to show how
easy it is to configure it for other libraries besides React. 

### Tech

- *Svelte*
- *Webpack*
- *Hot Module Reloading (server and client)*

### Todo

- [] Routing
- [] Code Splitting
